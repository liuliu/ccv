/// off an async copy, you need to read from its contents later in the
/// the shader. Otherwise, something inside the hardware (like a
/// DispatchSemaphore) will be waiting indefinitely to be notified. The bug
/// is a bit flaky, and only shows up for certain problem configurations. The
/// side effects are catastrophic; the GPU might freeze up until the computer
/// reboots.
///
/// Workaround: if an async copy from device -> threadgroup is launched,
/// guarantee that both:
/// - The threadgroup will enter another `threadgroup_barrier` before the end of
///   the kernel.
/// - The results of the async copy will be read from. This means at least one
///   thread must dereference a pointer within the region of threadgroup memory.
